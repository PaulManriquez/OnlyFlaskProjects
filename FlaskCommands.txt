Virtual environment
1) py -m venv env (will create the folder to hold the versions that you need)
2) env\Scripts\activate (Will activate the virtual enviroment)
3) pip freeze (shows the current Libraries/Packages installed)
4) pip install (flask) (pip install|librarie that you want)

5) set FLASK_APP = app.py (app.py is your main file where is running flask, in this line you are saying)
			  (to flask, what is your main application where will runs) 
6) flask run (Since we have stablish what is our flask page to run, we can type this command to run the server)

7) deactivate (disables the virtual environment)

8) export FLASK_DEBUG=1 | set FLASK_DEBUG=1 + flask run (Enter in debug mode in the terminal)

9) export FLASK_APP = (anotherFile.py) (You can change the name of the file to run another flask instance in terminal mode)

Run the aplication in debug mode 
* set FLASK_ENV=development | export Flask_ENV = development > flask run

I was having trouble connecting the data base as: 
sql = sqlite3.connect('/mnt/c/Users/Paul\ Manriquez/Desktop/FlaskProyects/DataBasesFlask/data.db')
with the absolute path where is located the data base, so the solution was to put directly in the proyect
my data base inside the directory "DataBase"


@app.route('/ShowDataBase')
def ShowContentInDataBase():
    db = get_db() # Conecction
    cur = db.execute('SELECT id, name, location from users') # Write the query
    results = cur.fetchall() #Retrieve the row data
    #Since we are only reading from the data base we dont need a commit sentece to do de query
    return render_template('ShowDataBase.html', results=results)

if you are using a reference style in a form like this: <form method="POST" action="{{url_for('view_F',date = '20170520')}}">
Ensure that {url_for('view_F'... ->viewF is the name of the reference to your endpoint


database is locked error: typically occurs when SQLite is unable to access the database because 
it is already being accessed by another connection.

My mistake: <a href="{{url_for('view_F',date = 'r.entry_date')}}.... '' in date= , this goes like this: date = r.entry_date, without ('')


* To avoid problems in the evaluation of if statements, prioritize the order of the conditions example:
{% if user and user['expert'] == 1 %}
   <li><a href="#">Answer Questions</a></li>
{% endif %}
// In this example im checking first if the user exist and then if accomplish certain conditions, it will be very diferent if we twist the order
