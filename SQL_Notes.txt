*An entity is a table beacuse it can holds multiple instances:
similarly like a class and instances of this, the instances in this case will be the data of the table

* SQL statements ussually are written in UpperCase to distinguish between data and SQL sentences
* All strings must be quoted so that the query parser can distinguish words in the string from SQL keywords.
* Imagine the reddit or pinterest web page, each link propmted to you is show based on popularity and time, 
  using LIMIT and OFFSET keywords, to filter data and retrieve it more faster.

* Primary key: is a field in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table
* Foregin key: is used to link two tables together. It acts as a cross-reference 
	       between tables because it references the primary key of another table, 
	       thus establishing a relationship between the two tables 

* Quote: The objective of being a primary key is that that row must to be unique, thus if you use
  a unique identifier will acomplish the rule, but is standarized to be autoincrement and unique

* INNER JOIN: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables being joined.
	      it focuses on the intersection of data between two tables.
